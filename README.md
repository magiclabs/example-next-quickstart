## Getting Started

After you've cloned this repo locally, we need to make sure you are using the right version of Node. We recommend installing nvm (node version manager) if you haven't already: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm . Then you can follow the guides there to switch to a Node version > 20

Next, we install the packages using:

`npm install`

Copy the `.env.example` file into a new file called `.env.local`, and replace the public key with one you created in your Magic Developer Dashboard (https://dashboard.magic.link/).

Finally run the development server with:

`npm run dev`
